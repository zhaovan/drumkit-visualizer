### Drumkit Visualizer

This is a really dumb project because I was thinking about making music on the web and was reminded by howler.js for some reason.

Simulates a 5 (???) piece drumkit with snare, bass, three toms, two cymbals, and a hihat.

Uses keyboard and clicking to represent the sounds.

Makes pretty dots show up.

Have fun
